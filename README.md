As a software engineer, I am always looking for ways to improve my understanding of data analysis and programming techniques. 
This project is part of my ongoing effort to enhance my skill set by analyzing a dataset that reflects the trends and patterns in the tech industry. 
The goal is to extract meaningful insights and translate them into actionable information using programming tools.

The dataset I analyzed comes from https://survey.stackoverflow.co/ (Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2024), 
which contains information about employees in the tech industry, their job roles, preferred programming languages, salaries, and more. 
This dataset provides a great opportunity to understand the dynamics of the tech workforce, including diversity, compensation trends, and skills employees are aiming to learn.

The purpose of this project is to improve my ability to analyze large datasets and build efficient software that can handle complex data queries. 
As I continue to grow as a software engineer, I see this kind of data analysis as an essential skill for solving real-world problems, making better decisions, 
and generating insights that could improve business strategies or support decision-making.

Hereâ€™s a demonstration video where I walk through the dataset, the questions and answers, and the code in action:
